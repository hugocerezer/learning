## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Nothing else...

### What I learned

Very basic usage of HTML + CSS. Positioning a <div> can be kind of painful for a beginner. Well, that said, it's done with a little persistence and stackoverflow.

### Continued development

Next step is continue training basic HTML and CSS until it's feel more clear in my mind. Looks like a long road to achieve this.

### Useful resources

## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Nothing else...

### What I learned

After two challenges done, it looks a way easier to make a flex <div> centered. After so many tries I couldn't make the icons looks like I want to. It's not properly centered with the text.

### Continued development

Next step is continue training basic HTML and CSS until it's feel more clear in my mind. Looks like a long road to achieve this.

### Useful resources

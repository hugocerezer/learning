## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Nothing else...

### What I learned

Very basic usage of HTML + CSS. Positioning a FLEX <div> can be kind of painful for a beginner. Even more than the [past challenge]()https://hugocerezer.github.io/learning/qr-code-component-main/.
Couldn't make it to be horizontally and vertically centered.  Horizontally should be enough for now. It's already a long time trying to find a solution.

### Continued development

Next step is continue training basic HTML and CSS until it's feel more clear in my mind. Looks like a long road to achieve this.

### Useful resources
